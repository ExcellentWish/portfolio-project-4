## User Experience
These user will be looking for:
- Informative website, with information that is easy-to-find & concise
- Current, up-to-date menus
- A booking form to make reservation enquiries with the restaurant

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. 

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design, I have used Bootstrap elements & custom CSS to allow for this.

## Scope
In order to acheuve the desired user & business goals the following features will be included in this release:

- Responsive navbar that will navigate to the various pages throughout the site
- Landing page with brief information about the restaurant and links to the menu and reservations page
- Menus page, with links to food & drinks menu respectively
- Reservations page, with booking form to enquire with the restaurant
- Register/login feature
- Contact form

## Structure
This website has been designed with simplicity in mind, each page only have entirely relevant information on it so that the user is able to find what they want quickly without having to read through unnessecary things. I have seperated out each key feature to really highlight their functionality to the user.

## Skeleton
[Wireframes can be viewed here](assets/documents/wireframes/WIREFRAMES.md)

The theme of simplicity follows through to the design, I've used bootstrap columns and rows to divide the pages and tried to keep the same layout throughout so that the user has a sense of ease when on the various pages.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Python is the core programming language used to write all of the code in this application to make it fully functional.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
